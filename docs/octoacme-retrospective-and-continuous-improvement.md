# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Include perspectives from all relevant roles (Dev, PM, PdM, UX, Support, Security, Data, Release)
- **Data Analyst** provides metrics to inform discussion
- **Support Lead** shares customer feedback and trends
- **Security Lead** highlights security learnings
- **Release Manager** reviews deployment effectiveness

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
