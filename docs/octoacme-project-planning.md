# OctoAcme â€” Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. Define cross-role handoffs and collaboration points
8. Establish communication channels and review cadences

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:
- Cross-role dependencies:
  - Design needed? (**UX Designer**)
  - Security review required? (**Security Lead**)
  - Analytics tracking? (**Data Analyst**)
  - Support documentation? (**Support Lead**)
  - Release coordination? (**Release Manager**)

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs

## Cross-Role Collaboration & Handoffs

### Design-to-Development Handoff
- **UX Designer** delivers: wireframes, prototypes, design specs, accessibility requirements
- **Developers** acknowledge: technical feasibility, implementation timeline
- Review: design review sessions during sprint planning

### Development-to-Release Handoff
- **Developers** deliver: merged PRs, passing tests, deployment scripts
- **Release Manager** verifies: pre-release checklist, security scans, rollback plan
- Review: release readiness meeting before deployment

### Release-to-Support Handoff
- **Release Manager** delivers: release notes, known issues, rollback procedures
- **Support Lead** acknowledges: customer communication plan, escalation paths
- Review: pre-release support briefing

### Analytics Handoff
- **Data Analyst** delivers: instrumentation requirements, dashboard specs
- **Developers** implement: tracking events, data validation
- Review: analytics review during code review and post-release

### Security Review Points
- Planning: **Security Lead** reviews architecture and threat model
- Development: Security scans in CI/CD pipeline
- Pre-release: **Security Lead** approves security scan results
- Post-incident: **Security Lead** conducts security retrospective
