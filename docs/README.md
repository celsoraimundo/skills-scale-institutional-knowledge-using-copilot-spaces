# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub. This guide serves as the main entry point for understanding how OctoAcme runs projects, defining roles, and navigating our complete set of process documents.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on customer-first principles, iterative delivery, and clear ownership. Our methodology emphasizes delivering small, testable increments while maintaining psychological safety and making data-informed decisions. Every project follows a structured lifecycle from initiation through retrospective, with defined roles, artifacts, and communication cadences to ensure alignment and transparency.

At the core of our approach are several key roles working in collaboration: Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, and risk; Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize the backlog; Developers implement features and collaborate on design; Release Managers orchestrate deployments; UX Designers create user-centered experiences; Support Leads manage customer impact; Security Leads ensure compliance and security; and Data Analysts provide metrics and insights. These roles work together through a standard set of artifacts including project charters, roadmaps, sprint backlogs, acceptance criteria, risk registers, and retrospective notes. Our process is designed to be lightweight yet comprehensive, providing just enough structure to maintain clarity without creating unnecessary overhead, while ensuring clear handoffs and accountability across functions.

The OctoAcme project lifecycle consists of five phases: initiation to validate business need and align stakeholders; planning to break work into shippable increments; execution to build, test, and iterate; release to deploy and verify; and close with retrospectives to capture learnings. Throughout this lifecycle, teams maintain consistent communication through weekly syncs, daily standups, and monthly stakeholder updates. Risk management and quality assurance are integrated at every stage, ensuring that teams can identify and mitigate issues early while maintaining high standards for deliverables.

   Instructions for turning approved initiatives into actionable plans, including backlog creation, sprint planning, estimation, dependency management, and release planning.

4. **[Execution and Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)**  
   Day-to-day execution guidance covering team rhythm, workflows, quality standards, reporting metrics, and blocker escalation processes.

5. **[Risk Management and Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)**  
   Frameworks for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks, plus stakeholder communication templates and escalation paths.

6. **[Release and Deployment](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)**  
   Standards for releasing features to production, including pre-release requirements, deployment checklists, rollback procedures, and release notes templates.

7. **[Retrospective and Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)**  
   Guidance for capturing learnings and converting them into actionable improvements through structured retrospectives and continuous improvement culture.

8. **[Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)**

## Getting Started

**New Team Members:** Start with the [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md) to understand our principles and lifecycle, then review [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) to understand your role and responsibilities.

**Starting a New Project:** Follow the sequence from [Project Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md) through [Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md) to establish your project foundation.

**Managing Active Projects:** Reference [Execution and Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md) for daily operations and [Risk Management and Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md) for stakeholder updates.

**Preparing for Release:** Consult [Release and Deployment](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md) for production deployment standards and best practices.

**Learning and Improving:** Use [Retrospective and Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md) to capture learnings and drive team evolution.

## How to Use These Documents

- Keep project-specific artifacts (charters, backlogs, risk registers) updated in your project repository
- Add process-specific documentation to `.copilot/` if you want GitHub Copilot Spaces to use them as context
- Reference these guides during kickoffs, planning sessions, and retrospectives
- Propose improvements through pull requests to keep our processes evolving
